# Organized, time to use linked lists !

## Description

Organized is a project involving the use of linked lists and understanding how they work. The aim of the project is to gain extensive knowledge about linked lists and algorithms in C. To achieve that, you create your own linked list and manipulate it to work in various situations. Organized supports a bonus format specifier: `-h`.

## Features

The Organized project supports the following specifier:

- `-h` : Displays information about the project, including the different commands to use.

## Installation

To compile the project, make sure to use the following folder structure:

```bash
/*.c && .h          # All necessary .c and .h files
/Makefile          # Makefile to automate compilation
/include/my.h      # The my.h file containing all function prototypes
```

Then, compile the project using the following commands:

```bash
make               # Create the lib with all .c files
make re            # Recompile all .c files after modifications
```

## Usage

```bash
./organized        # Start the program
./organized -h     # Display information
```
